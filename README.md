Auto Updates CI Git" refers to the integration of Continuous Integration (CI) practices with Git, a distributed version control system.
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository. Each merge triggers automated builds and tests, allowing for early detection of integration issues and bugs. This process helps maintain a high-quality codebase and reduces the time spent on debugging and resolving merge conflicts.
Git is the version control system used to manage the source code repository. Developers use Git to:
Commit changes: Record modifications to the codebase locally.
Push changes: Upload local commits to the central Git repository.
Pull changes: Download updates from the central repository to their local environment.
Create branches: Work on features or bug fixes in isolation before merging them into the main branch.
The relationship between CI and Git:
Git serves as the foundation for CI by providing the central repository where code changes are stored and managed. CI systems, such as GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins, monitor the Git repository for new commits or merge requests. When changes are detected, the CI system automatically triggers a pipeline of tasks, which can include:
Building the code:
Compiling the application or creating deployable artifacts.
Running automated tests:
Executing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
Performing static code analysis:
Checking for code quality, style violations, and potential security vulnerabilities.
Deploying the application:
Automatically deploying the tested code to various environments (e.g., staging, production).
In essence, Git provides the version control mechanism, and CI leverages this mechanism to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, facilitating a more efficient and reliable software development workflow.
